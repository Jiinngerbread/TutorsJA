# TutorsJA

TutorsJA is a software solution that will provide parents in Jamaica with a simple and powerful alternative for finding education providers for their children. This is particularly in response to the changing needs and circumstances of parents and students resulting from the COVID19 pandemic. TutorsJA will cater especially to parents who: are uncomfortable with sending their children to school physically due to the health risks; have children whose learning styles are not compatible with online learning/group online learning; have children who need or desire additional tutoring; have children with physical or learning disabilities thus requiring face-to-face teaching. 
Parents will be able to use the app to find and connect with qualified tutors/teachers providing either: 
      ● full-time individualized teaching, 
      ● part-time individualized teaching (extra-lessons), or 
      ● full-time group teaching in small classes 
      ● part-time group teaching in small classes 
These education options may be offered entirely online, in a blended format or face-to-face and will span from the Kindergarten 3 to the Grade 11 grade levels, with a variety of subject offerings and locations.

Parents will be able to indicate the grade(s), subject(s), delivery format(s) and location(s) they are interested in, in order to filter and find more suitable offers; search based on specific criteria; or even post a public message describing their unique need in order to receive an offer from a suitable tutor. The software will also show the availability status of  a particular Tutor’s service: ‘Free’, ‘Fully Booked’, “Services Withheld’ and “Not Accepting Requests”. Once interested in a particular service offering, parents will be able to indicate their interest to the tutor and engage in further discussions via the software’s messaging feature. Once a parent has enrolled their child with a tutor, and that child has completed at least half of their scheduled classes, they may give the tutor a rating as well as provide a review. Reviews will be visible to all other parents wishing to enrol their child with the Tutor. 

The hosting of classes will be determined, arranged and handled separately from the TutorsJA app by each tutor. 

TutorsJA will also provide its platform for ease of payment of Tutors by parents. Tutors will use the platform via membership subscription, payment for which will also be processed through the TutorsJA’s platform.
